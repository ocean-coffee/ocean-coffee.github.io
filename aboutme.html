           My barista dream began when I was just a teen and always dreamed of a barista job. I thought that when I finish high school I will move to London or New York, study and have a part time job as a barista at Starbucks or something. When I did in fact graduate high school I did not know what I would want to do with my life, so I had a gap year spent in UK volunteering in a church, after that I came back and had another gap year of just volunteering in my own local church. While I was here I decided to get a job and of course I applied to be a barista at a few coffee shops. One did employ me. I enjoyed working there, but it did not work out to stay long, so I worked there only for a little bit, but I already got to experience what job of a barista was. Later that year, at 2019, I started my studies at LCC when the pandemic hit during the first year. After my first year I knew I needed a job, but not coffee shops were hiring because of the uncertainty of how 2020 summer will be like. I applied to every single one I could find on the internet in Klaipėda and one did reply and hire me. This is were my story takes a shift.

           Having only roughly 4 months of barista experience I came into this place and realized something was really wrong. Everything I was taught was totally different from the last coffee shop I worked at. It felt so unhygienic, careless and non-professional. My boss would tell me all the time that “she knows better” and that I can’t trust what I have learned before, but the way she would do things seemed so wrong I started to wonder - how does one actually make coffee? I started to google “what is a latte”, “what is a cappuccino”, “what is a flat white” and slowly learned what these coffee drinks were supposed to look like. I started to slowly disobey my boss and make coffee in a good way, but still lacking a lot of knowledge and understanding of what I was doing. At the end of summer when I quit that job I promised myself that when the next time I go to work as a barista, I will go to a coffee shop that I will trust to teach me the way coffee is supposed to be made.

           That’s how after almost a year I landed my job at Musangas Coffee Roasters where I worked for 1,5 years. I remember how happy I was when I got that job. And I can truly say I am thankful to Mindaugas (my former boss) and Musangas for everything that they taught me. I was allowed to work with really professional equipment, see the roasting of coffee at hand, get to ask all of the questions I ever had, get to pack coffee every day, grind it for clients and brew all different kinds of coffee and espresso drinks. Through Musangas I also learned what filter coffee is, what is an aeropress, a V60, a Chemex and how to brew with these coffee makers. I also found my love for acidic coffee, I never would have guessed that I would enjoy a cup of nice berry fruity note cup of coffee without any milk or sugar.
After working in Musangas for while I got an offer to start a position at my university as they were opening a coffee shop. I got the chance to start working at Common Grounds and at first helping out with creating the menu and training all of the baristas on how to make coffee. After it I stayed as just a regular barista and I am currently still working there.
Not every coffee shop experience is portrayed here, but I have worked in 6 coffee shops so far and learned something new in each of them.

         Over the years my love for coffee grew and grew, I started visiting coffee shops in cities I would visit in Lithuania and in my travels abroad. And not just any coffee shops, those were specialty coffee shops that were working on their excellence in coffee and promising the best quality they can acquire. Seeing all of them succeed, the dream was born that one day I could open my own specialty coffee shop.         </p>

         I started to also get involved in different events to do with coffee, like making coffee at conferences or visiting Vilnius Coffee Festival.

Seeing all of these coffee shops succeed as well as taking any opportunity to make coffee for others, the dream was born that one day I could open my own specialty coffee shop. This has now started to seem like it’s moving to become reality. If you want to read what Ocean Coffee would look like you can click <a href="thecoffeeshopidea.html">here</a>.
