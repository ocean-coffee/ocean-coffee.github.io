      <h1>What is Ocean Coffee and who is Ocean?</h1>

         Hi! My full name is Aušrinė, but people tend to call me Ocean. My nickname came from some American missionaries who were visiting Lithuania in 2015 who kept mispronouncing my name. One day they said to me “You know, your name sounds really similar to the word Ocean” and I instantly thought “This will be my nickname!” From then on to everyone who couldn’t pronounce my name I would just say “or you can call me Ocean.” That year I also installed instagram on my phone and not knowing how to call myself I just went with peaceful.ocean which stuck, I still haven’t changed it to this day.
       </p>
       <p>
       I myself am a 24 year old 4th year Theology student at LCC International University in my home town - Klaipėda. I am a committed Christian, a crazy extrovert and a passionate barista. I found my true meaning of life when I found God when I was 16 and I haven’t turned from Him once. Faith gives me hope and purpose in this life, understanding that I never have to do life alone anymore, that I can do it all alongside Jesus, trusting His plan for my life because He knows what’s best for me better than I do. I cannot explain in words how much joy Jesus brought into my life and if I have a chance, I always like sharing it with people.
       </p>
       <p>
       Besides loving God and people, I also absolutely love coffee. This has been my passion not for that long, but it has been a fast growing one. With this passion and the lack of good specialty coffee shops in Klaipėda came the dream to open up my own coffee shop. Ocean Coffee would be different from all of the coffee shops we have in town and I wanna tell you all about it.
