      <h1>How would Ocean Coffee be different from other coffee shops?</h1>

      <h2>Ocean Coffee would be a Christian business</h1>

    <div class="two-column">
     <div>
       <p>
         As I myself am a Christian, I do not want to just keep my faith behind closed doors, I want it to be seen in all aspects of my life. Ocean Coffee being one. Ocean Coffee would be built on Christian principles of integrity, honesty, love, hospitality and many more. I would want to give full attention to costumes for them to feel like we care about them. I would want this coffee shop to be a light to the city.
       </p>

       <p>
       Some of the things I would add would be a prayer jar at the cashier so if anyone needs prayer, they can just write it down anonymously and put it in, and we’ll be praying for these people. There will be cards for answered prayers too, so people could share if the prayer was indeed answered. The coffee shop would work only until 5pm, so the evening time could be used by my church or other churches in the city to host Alpha or other events like youth gatherings. We would not work on Sundays, as I want both a day of for everybody, as well as to honor God and take a day of rest.

   <h2>Ocean Coffee would be a Specialty Coffee Shop</h1>

        <p>
          I care a lot about the quality of coffee so of course I would commit to learning more and more about coffee, to keep up the excellence of the coffee shop. I would train the baristas to have a very high standard of making coffee and even the slightest changes should not be tolerated. Such things as making a cup of coffee always with scales, determining our recipes to the amount of grams and milliliters and always keeping up the hygiene and sanitation levels. I would invest in the team's coffee knowledge and skills by taking them to training sessions and visiting other roasters and coffee shops multiple times a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would also invite the best baristas and roasters in Lithuania to come try our coffee and offer structured criticism on how we can make this better. The menu would be mostly just regular espresso and milk drinks, trying to stay away from the very sweet drinks. I would still like to source high quality syrups to make some nice sweet drinks, but this would not be the priority. Our coffee would be sourced green and then, having made a deal with Mindaugas and Musangas, I would roast it once a week in their cafe, and be able to offer both the best quality and freshest coffee to our customers to drink in the coffee shop or to bring it back to enjoy at home.

   <h2>Ocean Coffee would be a Sustainable business</h1>

   <div class="two-column">
    <div>
      <p>
        As well as caring about the values of the coffee shop and the quality of our coffee, I want to also not forget about sustainability. We can see the impact on our environment when we do not take care of it. I would commit to make Ocean Coffee a carbon neutral business, to offset all carbon dioxide we emit because of our existence.
      <p>
        I would also choose to partner with as many local businesses as it would be possible to source ingredients from Lithuania. I would want the milk we use in the coffee shop to be as ecological as possible. I am also considering to put a carbon tax and make cow milk more expensive to get your drinks with, while making vegan milk free of charge. I would also let customers vote for the charity of the season and donate 5% of our earnings to a certain charity 4 times a year.
